#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Head or tail coin tose  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized coin with a golden edge, showing a head side with a stylized face and a tail side with a stylized tail symbol, set against a simple gradient background. The coin is centered, with a subtle shadow to give depth. The background gradient fades from light blue at the top to white at the bottom, creating a calm, neutral backdrop. The coin's face side features a simple, abstract human face with a neutral expression, while the tail side displays a stylized tail symbol in a contrasting color. The overall design is clean, modern, and suitable for a web app logo.
